# Ejs testing project

## What will you find in this project?

This is a personal fiction website, I was learning how to use **Express** with ejs files and **Webpack**. Also, I worked in **HTML, CSS and JavaScript** (responsive design). I used some packages like **ScrollOut** for animations scrolling.

***This is only a project, so I can test different tools*** 

All the .html files you will find it in views folder, index.ejs is the main file. Also, in this folder you will find includes. This includes you will find it in index.ejs file.
